# Styling in React Native, like in React with Tailwind

This repository serves as an alternative to Nativewind or other className-based styling libraries. It can be implemented and customized swiftly. In projects like Expo, it allows for quick styling within custom components using the className prop. I have integrated the fundamental Tailwind props into the switch-case, which can be modified as needed!

## How to use it?
1. Copy "Layout.tsx" into your Expo, React Native, etc. project.
2. Create component(s) following the style of "ExampleComponent.tsx".
3. That's it!

## Example
```javascript
<ExampleComponent className="p-3 m-1 gap">
  <Text>Hello World!</Text>
  <Text>My Name is Kaan.</Text>
</ExampleComponent>
```

## Info
- You can add more props to "Layout.tsx".
- You can change padding, margin, gap sizes, etc. inside "Layout.tsx".

Feel free to add more!
