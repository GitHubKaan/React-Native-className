# Styling in React Native with Tailwind like in React

This repository serves as an alternative to Nativewind or other className-based libraries. It can be implemented and customized swiftly. In projects like Expo, it allows for quick styling within custom components using the className prop. I have integrated the fundamental Tailwind props into the switch-case, which can be modified as needed!

## How to use it?
1. Copy "Layout.tsx" into your Expo, React Native, etc. project.
2. Create components following the style of "ExampleComponent.tsx".
3. That's it!

## Info
- You can add more props to "Layout.tsx".
- You can change padding, margin, gap sizes, etc. inside "Layout.tsx".

Feel free to add more!
